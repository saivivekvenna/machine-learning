# machine-learning

This is my deep dive into machine learning fundamentals. 

**Goal: Understand how machine learning algorithms work and how to develop them from scratch.**

Real quick, I was inspired to do this when I saw Adam Maj's deep dives into various fields. Highly recommend checking his stuff out.
