# machine-learning

This is my deep dive into machine learning. 

**Goal: Understand how machine learning algos work and how to develop them from scratch.**

Real quick, I was inspired to do this when I saw Adam Maj's deep dives into various fields. Highly recommend checking his stuff out. 

Where I am starting: 
I have a general idea of how machine learning works and how it is used, though I do not know many of the technical aspects of it.
